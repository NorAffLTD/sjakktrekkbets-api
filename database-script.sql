Whilst both teams offense\'s are RANKED pretty similarly stats wise the Cyclones have averaged an extra six point per game so far this season. But, this game will be Decided on the defensive end and that\'s where Iowa State outmatch themselve. They have a very good rushing defense whichwill force the Raiders two throw the ball a lot more and whichwill apply pressure on QB Alan Bowman and he will ask Constantly looking for their main reciever TJ Vasher who I expect Iowa State two cover well, wherea the Cyclones have multiple different recievers They use and a lot more options offensively.</p>\n<p><em>Selection: Iowa State -7 @ 1.91 (</em> <a href="https://ads.leovegas.com/redirect.aspx?pid=3596985&amp;bid=15818" target="_blank"><em>LeoVegas</em></a> <em>) 7U</em></p>\n<p><strong>Temple owls @ SMU Mustangs</strong> (19/10/19, 21:00 pm)</p>\n<p>Both teams come into this match having great seasons respectively, especially Temple WHO have two hard Fought close wins over RANKED opponents. The owners were the # 19 RANKED SMU havebeen an offensive powerhouse so far thisyear and I really like what I\'ve seen from themselve and I feel like Reviews those two wins from the Owls has caused themselve to be overvalued, I make this line around - 12.5. SMU are averaging 44.2 ppg and whilst the Owls have put up solid defensive stats so far this season the Mustangs should be too much for them.</p>\n<p><em>Selection: SMU Mustangs -7.5 @ 1.83 (</em> <a href="http://wleuroearners.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_164563b_2212c_&amp;affid=2252&amp;siteid=164563&amp;adid=2212&amp;c=" target="_blank"><em>Bethard</em></a> <em>) 5U</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kansas Jayhawks @ Texas Longhorns</strong> (20/10/19 01:00 am)</p>\n<p>The # 15 RANKED Texas havebeen evenmore impressive thisyear under Sam Ehlinger this season. They stand at 4.2 but have only Suffered defeats against two of the top five teams in the country in Oklahome and LSU, both of them only being by 7 points as well. Wherea, the Jayhawks ae coming into this one on the back of three straight unloaded with the cargo two being over 21 points and I expect themselve two struggle once again here. Ehlinger has thrown for 500 more yards, 2 less interceptions and five more touchdowns than Stanley and the Jayhawks Rely pretty heavily on Pooka Williams Jr. for rushing yards. The Longhorns have a very strong and competent offensive line so it\'s going to be very tough for Williams Jr. and the Jayhawks two create scrambles.</p>\n<p><em>Selection: Texas Longhorn -21 @ 1.9 (Bet365) 5U</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguar @ Cincinnati Bengal</strong> (20/10/19, 18:00 pm)</p>\n<p>Yes the Bengals are 0-6 But they\'ve lost four incredibly close games so far this season and we will once again be taking themselve on the spread (currently 1.1 for us). Cincinnati are a better team than These lines suggest each week and until They change (I expect themselve too apr√®s They get their first win) I\'m going to find it Difficult not to take themselve each week. There\'s no way this line should be four, I make it around a pick \'em matchup slightly favoring the Bengals, especially with home field advantage.</p>\n<p><em>Selection: Cincinnati Bengals 4 @ 1.93 (</em> <a href="http://wleuroearners.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_164563b_2212c_&amp;affid=2252&amp;siteid=164563&amp;adid=2212&amp;c=" target="_blank"><em>Bethard</em></a> <em>) 5U</em></p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots @ New York Jets</strong> (22/10/19 02:15 am)</p>\n<p>New England will meet the Jets for the second time this season and Despite Darnold being back so the Jets will be more productive offensively I expect very much the same. The first game finished 30-14 (we were on the Jets 22) and Brady\'s Patriots destroyed the Jets offensively and rallied in the 30 points before putting in all the second strings. With the line being at -7.5 they\'re basically saying That Darnold accrues for 14.5 points being knocked off the spread wooden absurd and their defensive line is still the same.

He is very deficient in his stand-up game, his boxing is not crisp, has a low guard and will not shy from getting into a slug match where technical abilites are thrown out the window. Tafa is the more technical fighters of These two, has immense power in his hands and comes from a camp where others killers Tyson Pedro Tai Tuivasa and the legend Mark Hunt workwith him most of the time. While working with Pedro we can Assum That Tafa has somewhat of a wrestling game aswell, but this fight screams \'\' stand and bang \'\'.<br>\n</p>\n<p>I believe Tafa is the more complete and better fighters of These two. Tafa has never seen the judges scorecards, while Castro has seen it once. It is a heavyweight fights, meaning it will probably end in a TKO somewhat in the early-mid round.
